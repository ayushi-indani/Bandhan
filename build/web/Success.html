Thanks Shaadi.com for the help you provided in making my life complete - It was actually bit quick, we exchanged our profiles in June, 2011 and found it good for further discussion. Within 2 days of our face to face discussion in Delhi, we got engaged to each other and now we're married :)

Pretti & Jazz (06 January 2012) 
We would like to say a big thank you to Shaadi.com for helping us find true love. After years of searching for someone special we finally found each other and we just lived around the corner. When we met it was magical and we found an instant connection.We always believed that God had made someone out there for everyone but had left it for us to find one another and Shaadi.com helped this dream become reality.
